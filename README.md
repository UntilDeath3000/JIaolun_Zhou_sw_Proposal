# Bio
My name is Jiaolun Zhou, from Duke Kunshan University. My major is Computer Science, and my main research interests are machine learning and deep learning. I have some research in training models using the Transformer architecture and am also interested in 3D animation modeling and game programming.
# Discription for this Github
This study is dedicated to comparing the output accuracy and efficiency of Keyword Matching Based Retrieval Model (TF-IDF) and Semantic Similarity Based Retrieval Model (Word2Vec) in training intelligent Q&A models. Keyword matching based retrieval model is an approach based on index construction, query processing, match overriding and result sorting. Semantic similarity based retrieval model is an approach based on semantic representation, conceptual understanding and reasoning, similarity calculation, context sensitivity and answer generation or ranking. In general training, the keyword matching based approach is simple and easy to implement but less adaptive to language changes, while the semantic similarity based approach, although more complex and requires a larger dataset for training, is able to provide more accurate and flexible answers especially for dealing with complex natural language problems has significant advantages. In this paper, the two models will be trained separately using the same dataset to compare the performance of the two different approaches with a limited dataset.
