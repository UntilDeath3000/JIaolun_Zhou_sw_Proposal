#### Title:Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine(Lawrence, 1998) - Keyword Matching Based Retrieval Model
- Background/Motivation: The paper provides an overview of the challenges associated with building large-scale search engines, including the need to efficiently crawl and index massive amounts of data while producing high-quality search results. The authors note that despite the importance of these systems, relatively little academic research has been conducted on them.
- Research Question: The primary research question addressed in the paper is how to build a practical large-scale search engine that can effectively utilize the structure present in hypertext to produce better search results. The authors propose a method for addressing this question by leveraging both link structure and anchor text.
- Application Scenarios: The paper focuses primarily on the development of a search engine prototype called Google, which was designed to crawl and index the web efficiently and produce more satisfactory search results than existing systems. The authors discuss various aspects of the system, including its architecture, algorithms, and data structures.
- Methodology: The authors describe their approach to developing the Google search engine prototype, which involves leveraging the structure present in hypertext to improve search quality. They also discuss various technical challenges associated with scaling traditional search techniques to the level required for a large-scale system.
- Results: The paper provides an in-depth description of the Google search engine prototype, including its architecture, algorithms, and data structures. The authors demonstrate that the system is capable of efficiently crawling and indexing massive amounts of data while producing high-quality search results.
- Intellectual Merits/Practical Impacts: The paper represents an important contribution to the field of search engine development, particularly in terms of its focus on leveraging the structure present in hypertext to improve search quality. The authors' approach has significant practical implications for organizations seeking to develop large-scale search engines, and their work has helped to push the field forward in terms of understanding and advancing search engine technology. Additionally, the authors' emphasis on open-source development and collaboration has helped to promote transparency and accountability in the field.

## Research Idea: Predicting Diabetes Risk Using Machine Learning Techniques
- Background/Motivation:
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, causing significant health problems and economic burdens. Early detection and prevention are crucial for managing this disease effectively. Machine learning techniques have shown great potential in predicting the risk of developing diabetes based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, and other physiological measurements.

- Research Question:
Can machine learning algorithms accurately predict the risk of developing diabetes based on patient data? Make a comparison between XGBoost and SVM to conclude advantages and disadvantages of each techiniques.

- Application Scenarios:
The proposed research can have practical implications in healthcare settings, where it can be used to identify patients at high risk of developing diabetes and provide personalized preventive measures. It can also aid medical professionals in making informed decisions about treatment plans and disease management strategies.

- Methodology:
The study will use supervised machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict the risk of developing diabetes. The dataset will be preprocessed to remove any missing values or outliers, and feature engineering techniques will be applied to extract relevant information from the data. Cross-validation techniques will be employed to evaluate the performance of different models and select the best one.

- Results:
The study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting the risk of developing diabetes with high accuracy. The results will provide insights into the most important features contributing to the development of diabetes and help identify areas for further research.

- Intellectual Merits/Practical Impacts:
This research has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of healthcare and improve patient outcomes. By identifying individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, healthcare providers can intervene early and prevent the onset of the disease. Additionally, the findings of this study can inform public health policies and strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of diabetes globally.
